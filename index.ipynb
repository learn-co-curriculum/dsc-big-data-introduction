    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the information age, data in huge quantities has become available to analysts and decision makers. Big data Analytics involves dealing with data that is big in __volume__ and high in __variety__ and __velocity__, making it challenging for data scientists to run their routine analysis activities. Due to the a vast increase in the amount of such data in recent times, A number of specialized platforms and development paradigms have been developed to fulfill this need. Using such specialist approaches allow data scientists to gain valuable insights from such complex data, ranging from daily transactions to customer interactions and social network data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Data Analytics is the application of advanced analytics techniques on big data. This section aims to focus on some of the different analytical approaches and tools which can be applied to big data to gain valuable insights to aid business decision making. \n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "- Understand and explain how big data differs from routine data that is routinely analyzed\n",
    "- Describe 3 V's of big data as attributes that differentiate big data\n",
    "- Evaluate big data technologies and application areas for Big Data Analytics"

    "The topic of \"Big Data\" has received a lot of hype lately, accompanied by huge amount interest from big businesses as it can potentially provide them data driven decision making abilities. Big data is one of the most discussed topics in business today across industry sectors, although it was barely known a few years ago. This lesson will focus on what big data is, why it is important, and the benefits it brings. \n",

    "Big data is no different than normal data that we have seen so far , its only Bigger. This changes the analytical landscape as the huge increase in size of the data required specialist tools, techniques and platforms, big data analytics deals with. It helps us solve new problems and find improved ways for old problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining Big Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite of all the hype around this topic, there is no clear consensus on __How to define Big Data__ . The term often gets related to Business Analytics and Data mining for identifying relationships and associations present in huge amounts of transaction data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the data science domain, Big Data usually refers to datasets that grow so large that they become awkward to work with using traditional database management systems and analytical approaches. They are data sets whose size is beyond the ability of commonly used software tools and storage systems to capture, store, manage, as well as process the data within a tolerable elapsed time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Big is the Big Data ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Big data sizes are constantly increasing, currently ranging from a few terabytes (TB) to many petabytes (PB) of data in a single data set. Consequently, some of the difficulties related to big data include capture, storage, search, sharing, analytics, and visualizing. Today, enterprises are exploring large volumes of highly detailed\n",
    "data so as to discover facts they didn’t know before. The sources of data that companies usually deal with along with their application areas are highlighted in the image below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"size2.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the examples of big data:\n",
    "- Web data. Customer level web behaviour data such as page views, searches, reading reviews, purchasing, can be captured. \n",
    "- Text data (email, news, Facebook feeds, documents, etc) is one of the biggest and most widely applicable types of big data. \n",
    "- Time and location data. GPS and mobile phone as well as Wi-Fi connection makes time and location information a growing source of data. \n",
    "- Smart grid and sensor data. Sensor data are collected nowadays from cars, oil pipes, windmill turbines, and they  are collected in extremely high frequency. Sensor data provides powerful information on the performance of engines and machinery. \n",
    "- Social network data. Within social network sites like Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, it is possible to do link analysis to uncover the network of a given user. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3 V's of Big Data \n",
    "\n",
    "Three main features characterize big data: volume, variety, and velocity, or the three V’s. The volume of the data is its size, and  how enormous it is. Velocity refers to the rate with which data is changing, or how\n",
    "often it is created. Finally, variety includes the different formats and types of data, as well as the different kinds of uses and ways of analyzing the data\n",

    "### VOLUME\n",
    "Volume refers to the __amount of data__ generated through websites, portals and online applications in a data driven business. Especially for online retailers, volume encompasses the available data that are out there and need to be assessed for relevance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"users.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "Facebook has 2 billion users, Youtube: 1.5 billion users, Twitter: ~400 million users and Instagram 700 million users. Every day, these users contribute to billions of images, posts, videos, tweets etc. You can now imagine the insanely large amount (or Volume) of data that is generated every minute and every hour.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Data volume is the primary attribute of big data. Big data can be quantified by size in TBs or PBs, as well as even the number of records, transactions, tables, or files. Additionally, one of the things that make big data really big is that it’s coming from a greater variety of sources than ever before, including logs, clickstreams, and social media as we will see below.

    "\n",
    "### VELOCITY\n",
    "Velocity refers to the speed with which data is generated. Staying with our social media example, every day 900 million photos are uploaded on Facebook, 500 million tweets are posted on Twitter, 0.4 million hours of video are uploaded on Youtube and 3.5 billion searches are performed in Google. This is like a nuclear data explosion. \n",

    "Big Data helps the company to hold this explosion in velocity, accept the incoming flow of data and at the same time process it fast so that it does not create bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VARIETY\n",
    "\n",
    "Variety in Big Data refers to all the structured and unstructured data that has the possibility of getting generated either by humans or by machines. The most commonly added data are structured -texts, tweets, pictures & videos. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to above,  unstructured data like emails, voice mails, hand-written text, ECG reading, audio recordings etc, are also important elements under Variety. Variety is all about the ability to classify the incoming data into various categories.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is also important to point out that there might not be too much value in defining an absolute threshold for what constitutes big data. Today’s big data may not be tomorrow’s big data as technologies evolve. It is more of  a relative concept. From anyone’s given perspective, if your organization is facing significant challenges (and opportunities) around data’s volume, velocity and variety, it is your big data challenge. Typically, these challenges introduce the need for distinct data management and delivery technologies and techniques."

Yet, the content that is generated from social media websites is enormous and remains largely unexploited. However, social media analytics can be used to analyze such data and extract useful information and predictions \n",

    "On the other hand, __Text Mining__ and __NLP__ techniques are used to analyze a document or set of documents in order to understand the content within and the meaning of the information contained. Text mining has become very important nowadays since most of the information stored, not including audio, video, and images, consists of text - in form on emails, sms, social media feeds, blogs etc. While data mining deals with structured data, text presents special characteristics which basically follows a non-relational form.\n",
